    <p class="text-gray-600">Hi there. I go by <a class="underline decoration-emerald-800">mosiman</a> on the internet, Dillon in meatspace. I think a lot about data. I studied Applied Mathematics at the University of Waterloo. I currently live in Ottawa, Ontario.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-600">I have previously held roles in DevOps, Machine Learning Engineering, and general software development.</p>
    </br>
    <p class="text-gray-600">I have an unusual obsession with backpacks and other ways to haul your stuff around. I enjoy tinkering with bikes and writing little bits of code on whatever holds my interest. I have also been largely unsuccessful with learning Japanese, but haven't given it up yet.</p>
