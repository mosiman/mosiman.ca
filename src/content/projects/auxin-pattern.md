## Project Description

Using a large system of ordinary differential equations to model a unit-discrete system (in this case, plant cells), we gain insight into the spatial and temporal behaviour of the system. We extended previous research by considering external forcing. AMATH 382 final project.

## Notable Technology

- Python with Matplotlib, SciPy, NumPy
- Modelling via Ordinary Differential Equations
